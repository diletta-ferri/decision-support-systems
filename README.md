<h1>Decision Support Systems</h1>
<h3>Laboratory of Data Science</h3>

This repository holds the project for the course of Laboratory of Data Science, within the Decision Support Systems course. <br/>
You can find the final report in the file <i>Final Report.pdf</i> <br>
<h5>Part 1</h5>
In Part 1 of the project, you are required to create and populate a database starting from different files and perform some operations on it.
<h5>Part 2</h5>
In Part 2 of the project you are required to solve some problems on the database you created in Part 1. 
Solve the exercises using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) with computation on the client side (i.e., do not use any SQL command in the nodes, only standard SSIS nodes).
<h5>Part 3</h5>
In Part 3 of the project, you have to answer some business questions on a datacube you will create on the database you prepared. 
Document how you build your datacube in your report and solve the business questions using MultiDimensional eXpressions (MDX) in SQL management studio.
